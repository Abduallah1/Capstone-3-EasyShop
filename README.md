# Capstone 3: EasyShop

## **Project Overview**
EasyShop is an e-commerce application built as part of the Capstone 3 project. The application features a robust backend API built with Spring Boot, integrating a MySQL database for persistent data storage. It includes essential e-commerce functionalities such as user registration, authentication, product management, shopping cart operations, and order management.

The project demonstrates skills in building scalable web applications, utilizing RESTful APIs, securing data using JWT authentication, and implementing database-backed operations.

### **Steps to Run the Application**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abduallah1/Capstone-3-EasyShop.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Capstone-3-EasyShop
   ```
3. Configure the database connection in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/easyshop
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```
4. Build and run the application:
